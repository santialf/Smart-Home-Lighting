Required platforms:
Arduino IDE 2.0.4

Setup Instructions:
Arduino - Connect an ESP32 board and run the Arduino Code on it, 
the only values that need to be changed are related to the local wifi login.
An entire circuit setup is needed to actually run the functions of the arduino to observe results.
Some commented Serial.prints are available (commented) to view the values the arduino gets from the database without needing any circuit setup.
